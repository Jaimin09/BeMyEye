# **BeMyEye**
BeMyEye is an app to help visually impaired people to do their everyday task independently.

## The Problem
It is estimated that 285 million people on this planet are visually impaired, out of which 39 million are blind. It is very difficult for them to do daily activities without the help of others. Some of the day to day problems they face are not being able to find a particular object they want, not being able to read any document or anything on any products, and not being able to know how far the objects around are.

## The Solution
So, to overcome the above stated problem, we have come up with a solution (a mobile app) to help visually impaired people do their day to day tasks independently. Our mobile app is known as BeMyEye.

## What it does?
It is a mobile app that:
* Detects all the object in the surrounding with their distance.
* Locates a particular object as stated by the user along with its distance.
* Describes the surrounding to the user.
* Reads text from the given image.
